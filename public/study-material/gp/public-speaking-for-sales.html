                            career paths in various ways. One difference is how sales people are paid. For example, Raul
                            makes much more money than Betty even though they both work in sales for the same company
                            and were hired at the same time. Raul, however, sells twice as much as Betty and, therefore,
                            makes twice as much money. This pay disparity is possible because sales is a __________
                            profession.

                        conservative company that prints and sells Bibles. Most of her sales force is made up of religiously oriented,
                        conservative people. Will, who works under Rebecca on the company’s sales force, differs in that he is not conservative
                        and does not enjoy working in the environment he is in. He has a negative effect on the whole sales staff. Rebecca has
                        to let him go because he interferes with which component of the sales team?

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;39)&nbsp; Phil Gerber is a sales training expert. His advice for how to conduct sales training can best be described as:
                        Select one:<br><br>
                        &nbsp; front loaded.<br>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;40)&nbsp; Barnaby is a sales manager for a brick company. Construction is down and, therefore, sales are slow. It is Barnaby’s job
                        to keep sales moving. Barnaby has a range of ways to evaluate his team to see how he can help them. According to
                        McKinnis, what should replace the “Pain Chain”?

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;41)&nbsp; Chris Stiehl suggests that sales managers should work to determine what their sales staff wants and needs. This involves
                        researching and surveying the sales staff and figuring out how those items can be met. Stiehl argues that managers
                        should treat their sales staff like:
                        Select one:<br>
                        &nbsp; kings and queens.<br>
