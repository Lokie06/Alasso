                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;1)&nbsp;Which of the following best describes money? <br> <br>

                            &nbsp; A shared belief held by the members of society <br>

                            &nbsp; A battery for society, like stored energy to be drawn on by users <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">A good selected for by society based on objective
                                characteristics</strong> <br> </p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;2)&nbsp;Why did the classical gold standard break down? <br> <br>

                            &nbsp; Attacks by speculative investors caused price fluctuations <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">Governments no longer kept the monetary promises they were
                                entrusted with</strong> <br>

                            &nbsp; Paper currencies provided more productivity by enabling the faster flow of money <br>
                        </p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;3)&nbsp;Why is durability important for money? <br> <br>

                            &nbsp; Being durable is a show of "unforgeable costliness" <br>

                            &nbsp; Being hard to destroy helps make it a more impressive monetary good <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">If it were easily destroyed, people could no longer trade using
                                that monetary good</strong>
                            <br>
                        </p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;4)&nbsp;Who benefits from fiat inflation, and what are the
                            consequences of it? <br><br>

                            &nbsp;People with money in a savings account benefit since they will receive increased
                            interest
                            rates <br>

                            &nbsp;People who are owed money benefit since it becomes easier for the person in debt to
                            repay the
                            debt <br>

                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">Debt holders benefit since their debts are 'inflated away', which
                                creates incentives
                                to take
                                on unsustainable debts</strong> <br></p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;5)&nbsp;What does proof of work in Bitcoin achieve? <br><br>

                            &nbsp;It reduces the computational load on the computers participating in the network <br>

                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">It ties the physical world to consensus in Bitcoin's ledger since
                                it is costly to produce</strong> <br>

                            &nbsp;It helps identify prime numbers that may have applications in other areas of science
                            and
                            technology <br></p>


                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;6)&nbsp;Over recent decades, what has happened to the "risk-free rate of
                            return"? <br> <br>

                            &nbsp;It has gone up <br>

                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">It has gone down </strong><br>

                            &nbsp;It has stayed about even <br></p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;7)&nbsp;If Bitcoin were to succeed at becoming widely used as money, why
                            would this be? <br> <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">It has more credible monetary properties</strong> <br>

                            &nbsp; It has a stronger 'religion' or faith built around it <br>

                            &nbsp; It achieved government approval and acceptance <br></p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;8)&nbsp;Why is it unlikely that governments in the free world will ban
                            Bitcoin? <br> <br>

                            &nbsp; Bitcoin small, and does not seem as if it will grow to a size that will cause
                            governments to
                            consider banning it <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">As more users adopt Bitcoin and agree that it will rise in value
                                so dramatically, bans will
                                become politically unfeasible</strong> <br>

                            &nbsp; Bitcoin operates completely outside the purview of all governments in the world, and
                            is
                            therefore "unbannable" <br></p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;9)&nbsp;What were the "crypto wars" about? <br> <br>

                            &nbsp; Being able to make cryptocurrencies free from government regulation in relation to
                            securities <br>

                            &nbsp; A series of yearly contests where cryptographers would meet up and try to break each
                            other's
                            encryption algorithms <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">Disagreements between the intelligence community and privacy
                                activists over the rights of
                                citizens to use end-to-end encryption</strong> <br></p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;10)&nbsp;What was a distinguishing feature of Nick Szabo's Bit Gold? <br>
                            <br>

                            &nbsp; It included a Bit Gold mining scheme to help with the creation of new Bit Gold <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">It included a digital ownership registry with hashes linked to
                                public keys of their creators </strong><br>

                            &nbsp; It provided collision resistance making it hard to find two inputs that hash to the
                            same
                            output. <br></p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;11)&nbsp;Bitcoin development reached a stalemate in 2016 due to
                            disagreements over which of the
                            following? <br><br>

                            &nbsp; The method of marketing Bitcoin <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">The method of scaling Bitcoin using larger blocks</strong> <br>

                            &nbsp; The way Bitcoin users should connect to the network <br></p>


                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;12)&nbsp;What would happen if the Bitcoin blockchain had multiple
                            competing branches? <br><br>

                            &nbsp; Bitcoin as a project would die, since Bitcoin has no way to deal with this scenario
                            <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">Potential 'ties' would be broken as new blocks are formed, since
                                the network switches to the
                                longest branch available</strong> <br>

                            &nbsp; A developer would have to intervene to select which chain is correct, which is why
                            developers
                            need to be supported <br></p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;13)&nbsp;Nowadays, what kind of technology is required to competitively
                            mine Bitcoin? <br> <br>

                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans"> ASIC</strong> <br>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;14)&nbsp;The saying "Not your keys, not your coins" refers to which type
                            of key? <br>

                            &nbsp; Public keys <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">Private keys</strong> <br>

                            Bitcoin and altcoins also offer a distinctive choice in which of the following
                            characteristics? <br> <br>

                            &nbsp; Using a blockchain <br>

                            &nbsp; Using public addresses <br>

                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans"> Having a credibly fixed supply limit</strong> <br></p>

                        <p class="boxes">&nbsp;16)&nbsp;
                            What would happen if the current maintainers tried to organize a coup on the Bitcoin GitHub
                            repository? <br><br>

                            &nbsp; The ecosystem would be tricked into following them <br>

                            &nbsp; The ecosystem would notice, but would still be forced to follow them <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">The focal point for development would shift i.e. people would run

                            What does open source development mean? <br><br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">The source code is available to be contributed to</strong> <br>

                            &nbsp; Developers must remain open-minded at all times <br>

                            &nbsp; The source code is not able to be contributed to but is available <br></p>

                            &nbsp; Buying from a regulated OTC provider <br>

                            &nbsp; Buying from a large regulated exchange <br>

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">Buying it peer-to-peer from someone at a meetup</strong> <br></p>

                            For larger amounts of Bitcoin, what kind of wallet is suitable? <br><br>

                            &nbsp; Phone wallet <br>

                            &nbsp; Desktop wallet <br>

                            <br><br>

                            &nbsp; It helps with using the Lightning Network <br>

                            &nbsp; Open Source software uses more advanced security techniques <br>

                            In what context does it usually make more sense to use Lightning Network transactions
                            instead of
                            Bitcoin on-chain transactions? <br><br>

                            &nbsp; For very large, high-value transactions <br>

                            &nbsp; It was difficult to exchange gold during wartime <br>

                            &nbsp; Gold was not efficient enough as a transfer mechanism <br>

                            &nbsp; Hoarding is bad for society because it creates situations where there is not enough

                            &nbsp; Deflation can only have negative impacts on society because fewer people will spend

                            &nbsp; <strong class="ans">Growth deflation is beneficial because as society produces more,
